<h3>Excluded sequences</h3>

CoV-GLUE excludes the following GISAID sequences from its analysis:

<ul>
<li>Any sequence of length less than 29000 nucleotides or greater than 35000</li>
<li>Any sequence with a non-human host, e.g. bat, pangolin</li>
<li>Sequences from environmental samples</li>
<li>Any sequences which cover less than 95% of the coding region</li>
<li>Any sequence with more than 10 unique (across the whole dataset) single nucleotide mutations relative to Wuhan-Hu-1.</li>
<li>Any sequence which we detect has a frameshifting deletion or insertion relative to Wuhan-Hu-1.</li>
</ul>
